This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit a091fab020ac26548250c907bae0855273a98778.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n",

Define your data structure used in (query, json, headers, cookies, resp) with `pydantic.BaseModel`\n    37\t2. create `spectree.SpecTree` instance with the web framework name you are using, like `api = SpecTree('flask')`\n    38\t3. `api.validate` decorate the route with\n    39\t   * `query`\n    40\t   * `json`\n    41\t   * `headers`\n    42\t   * `cookies`\n    43\t   * `resp`\n    44\t   * `tags`\n    45\t4. access these data with `context(query, json, headers, cookies)` (of course, you can access these from the original place where the framework offered)\n    46\t   * flask: `request.context`\n    47\t   * falcon: `req.context`\n    48\t   * starlette: `request.context`\n    49\t5. register to the web application `api.register(app)`\n    50\t6. check the document at URL location `/apidoc/redoc` or `/apidoc/swagger`\n    51\t\n    52\tIf the request doesn't pass the validation, it will return a 422 with JSON error message(ctx, loc, msg, type).\n    53\t\n    54\t## How To\n    55\t\n    56\t> How to add summary and description to endpoints?\n    57\t\n    58\tJust add docs to the endpoint function.

Check the [config](https://spectree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) document.\n    67\t\n    68\tYou can update the config when init the spectree like: \n    69\t\n    70\t```py\n    71\tSpecTree('flask', title='Demo API', version='v1.0', path='doc')\n    72\t```\n    73\t\n    74\t> What is `Response` and how to use it?\n    75\t\n    76\tTo build a response for the endpoint, you need to declare the status code with format `HTTP_{code}` and corresponding data (optional).\n    77\t\n    78\t```py\n    79\tResponse(HTTP_200=None, HTTP_403=ForbidModel)\n    80\tResponse('HTTP_200') # equals to Response(HTTP_200=None)\n    81\t```\n    82\t\n    83\t> What should I return when I'm using the library?\n    84\t\n    85\tNo need to change anything. Just return what the framework required.\n    86\t\n    87\t> How to logging when the validation failed?\n    88\t\n    89\tValidation errors are logged with INFO level. Details are passed into `extra`. Check the [falcon example](examples/falcon_demo.py) for details.\n    90\t\n    91\t> How can I write a customized plugin for another backend framework?\n    92\t\n    93\tInherit `spectree.plugins.base.BasePlugin` and implement the functions you need. After that, init like `api = SpecTree(backend=MyCustomizedPlugin)`.\n    94\t\n    95\t> How can I change the response when there is a validation error? Can I record some metrics?\n    96\t\n    97\tThis library provides `before` and `after` hooks to do these. Check the [doc](https://spectree.readthedocs.io/en/latest) or the [test case](tests/test_plugin_flask.py).

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets.

RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8.

Define your data structure used in (query, json, headers, cookies, resp) with `pydantic.BaseModel`\n    37\t2. create `spectree.SpecTree` instance with the web framework name you are using, like `api = SpecTree('flask')`\n    38\t3. `api.validate` decorate the route with\n    39\t   * `query`\n    40\t   * `json`\n    41\t   * `headers`\n    42\t   * `cookies`\n    43\t   * `resp`\n    44\t   * `tags`\n    45\t4. access these data with `context(query, json, headers, cookies)` (of course, you can access these from the original place where the framework offered)\n    46\t   * flask: `request.context`\n    47\t   * falcon: `req.context`\n    48\t   * starlette: `request.context`\n    49\t5. register to the web application `api.register(app)`\n    50\t6. check the document at URL location `/apidoc/redoc` or `/apidoc/swagger`\n    51\t\n    52\tIf the request doesn't pass the validation, it will return a 422 with JSON error message(ctx, loc, msg, type).\n    53\t\n    54\t## How To\n    55\t\n    56\t> How to add summary and description to endpoints?\n    57\t\n    58\tJust add docs to the endpoint function.

Check the [config](https://spectree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) document.\n    67\t\n    68\tYou can update the config when init the spectree like: \n    69\t\n    70\t```py\n    71\tSpecTree('flask', title='Demo API', version='v1.0', path='doc')\n    72\t```\n    73\t\n    74\t> What is `Response` and how to use it?\n    75\t\n    76\tTo build a response for the endpoint, you need to declare the status code with format `HTTP_{code}` and corresponding data (optional).\n    77\t\n    78\t```py\n    79\tResponse(HTTP_200=None, HTTP_403=ForbidModel)\n    80\tResponse('HTTP_200') # equals to Response(HTTP_200=None)\n    81\t```\n    82\t\n    83\t> What should I return when I'm using the library?\n    84\t\n    85\tNo need to change anything. Just return what the framework required.\n    86\t\n    87\t> How to logging when the validation failed?\n    88\t\n    89\tValidation errors are logged with INFO level. Details are passed into `extra`. Check the [falcon example](examples/falcon_demo.py) for details.\n    90\t\n    91\t> How can I write a customized plugin for another backend framework?\n    92\t\n    93\tInherit `spectree.plugins.base.BasePlugin` and implement the functions you need. After that, init like `api = SpecTree(backend=MyCustomizedPlugin)`.\n    94\t\n    95\t> How can I change the response when there is a validation error? Can I record some metrics?\n    96\t\n    97\tThis library provides `before` and `after` hooks to do these. Check the [doc](https://spectree.readthedocs.io/en/latest) or the [test case](tests/test_plugin_flask.py). You can change the handlers for SpecTree or for a specific endpoint validation.\n    98\t\n    99\t## Demo\n   100\t\n   101\tTry it with `http post :8000/api/user name=alice age=18`.

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit a091fab020ac26548250c907bae0855273a98778.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n"

The problem is that when adding descriptions to schema fields used in query parameters, they don't show up in Swagger UI but they do show up in Redoc.\\n\\n2. Looking at the code snippet:\\n   - There's a FastAPI route decorated with @api.validate(query=HelloForm) \\n   - The HelloForm class inherits from BaseModel (likely from pydantic)\\n   - One of the fields (msg) has a Field(description='msg test', example='aa') annotation\\n   - Other fields like user, index, data, list are also defined\\n\\n3. The issue shows screenshots comparing Swagger UI vs Redoc:\\n   - In Swagger UI: The description \\\"msg test\\\" is NOT visible\\n   - In Redoc: The description \\\"msg test\\\" IS visible\\n\\n4.

The problem is that when adding descriptions to schema fields used in query parameters, they don't show up in Swagger UI but they do show up in Redoc.\n\n2. Looking at the code snippet:\n   - There's a FastAPI route decorated with @api.validate(query=HelloForm) \n   - The HelloForm class inherits from BaseModel (likely from pydantic)\n   - One of the fields (msg) has a Field(description='msg test', example='aa') annotation\n   - Other fields like user, index, data, list are also defined\n\n3. The issue shows screenshots comparing Swagger UI vs Redoc:\n   - In Swagger UI: The description \"msg test\" is NOT visible\n   - In Redoc: The description \"msg test\" IS visible\n\n4.

Define your data structure used in (query, json, headers, cookies, resp) with `pydantic.BaseModel`\n    37\t2. create `spectree.SpecTree` instance with the web framework name you are using, like `api = SpecTree('flask')`\n    38\t3. `api.validate` decorate the route with\n    39\t   * `query`\n    40\t   * `json`\n    41\t   * `headers`\n    42\t   * `cookies`\n    43\t   * `resp`\n    44\t   * `tags`\n    45\t4. access these data with `context(query, json, headers, cookies)` (of course, you can access these from the original place where the framework offered)\n    46\t   * flask: `request.context`\n    47\t   * falcon: `req.context`\n    48\t   * starlette: `request.context`\n    49\t5. register to the web application `api.register(app)`\n    50\t6. check the document at URL location `/apidoc/redoc` or `/apidoc/swagger`\n    51\t\n    52\tIf the request doesn't pass the validation, it will return a 422 with JSON error message(ctx, loc, msg, type).\n    53\t\n    54\t## How To\n    55\t\n    56\t> How to add summary and description to endpoints?\n    57\t\n    58\tJust add docs to the endpoint function.

Check the [config](https://spectree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) document.\n    67\t\n    68\tYou can update the config when init the spectree like: \n    69\t\n    70\t```py\n    71\tSpecTree('flask', title='Demo API', version='v1.0', path='doc')\n    72\t```\n    73\t\n    74\t> What is `Response` and how to use it?\n    75\t\n    76\tTo build a response for the endpoint, you need to declare the status code with format `HTTP_{code}` and corresponding data (optional).\n    77\t\n    78\t```py\n    79\tResponse(HTTP_200=None, HTTP_403=ForbidModel)\n    80\tResponse('HTTP_200') # equals to Response(HTTP_200=None)\n    81\t```\n    82\t\n    83\t> What should I return when I'm using the library?\n    84\t\n    85\tNo need to change anything. Just return what the framework required.\n    86\t\n    87\t> How to logging when the validation failed?\n    88\t\n    89\tValidation errors are logged with INFO level. Details are passed into `extra`. Check the [falcon example](examples/falcon_demo.py) for details.\n    90\t\n    91\t> How can I write a customized plugin for another backend framework?\n    92\t\n    93\tInherit `spectree.plugins.base.BasePlugin` and implement the functions you need. After that, init like `api = SpecTree(backend=MyCustomizedPlugin)`.\n    94\t\n    95\t> How can I change the response when there is a validation error? Can I record some metrics?\n    96\t\n    97\tThis library provides `before` and `after` hooks to do these. Check the [doc](https://spectree.readthedocs.io/en/latest) or the [test case](tests/test_plugin_flask.py). You can change the handlers for SpecTree or for a specific endpoint validation.\n    98\t\n    99\t## Demo\n   100\t\n   101\tTry it with `http post :8000/api/user name=alice age=18`.

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit a091fab020ac26548250c907bae0855273a98778.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n"

Check the [config](https://spectree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) document.\n    67\t\n    68\tYou can update the config when init the spectree like: \n    69\t\n    70\t```py\n    71\tSpecTree('flask', title='Demo API', version='v1.0', path='doc')\n    72\t```\n    73\t\n    74\t> What is `Response` and how to use it?\n    75\t\n    76\tTo build a response for the endpoint, you need to declare the status code with format `HTTP_{code}` and corresponding data (optional).\n    77\t\n    78\t```py\n    79\tResponse(HTTP_200=None, HTTP_403=ForbidModel)\n    80\tResponse('HTTP_200') # equals to Response(HTTP_200=None)\n    81\t```\n    82\t\n    83\t> What should I return when I'm using the library?\n    84\t\n    85\tNo need to change anything. Just return what the framework required.\n    86\t\n    87\t> How to logging when the validation failed?\n    88\t\n    89\tValidation errors are logged with INFO level. Details are passed into `extra`. Check the [falcon example](examples/falcon_demo.py) for details.\n    90\t\n    91\t> How can I write a customized plugin for another backend framework?\n    92\t\n    93\tInherit `spectree.plugins.base.BasePlugin` and implement the functions you need. After that, init like `api = SpecTree(backend=MyCustomizedPlugin)`.\n    94\t\n    95\t> How can I change the response when there is a validation error? Can I record some metrics?\n    96\t\n    97\tThis library provides `before` and `after` hooks to do these. Check the [doc](https://spectree.readthedocs.io/en/latest) or the [test case](tests/test_plugin_flask.py). You can change the handlers for SpecTree or for a specific endpoint validation.\n    98\t\n    99\t## Demo\n   100\t\n   101\tTry it with `http post :8000/api/user name=alice age=18`.

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit a091fab020ac26548250c907bae0855273a98778.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n"

Define your data structure used in (query, json, headers, cookies, resp) with `pydantic.BaseModel`\n    37\t2. create `spectree.SpecTree` instance with the web framework name you are using, like `api = SpecTree('flask')`\n    38\t3. `api.validate` decorate the route with\n    39\t   * `query`\n    40\t   * `json`\n    41\t   * `headers`\n    42\t   * `cookies`\n    43\t   * `resp`\n    44\t   * `tags`\n    45\t4. access these data with `context(query, json, headers, cookies)` (of course, you can access these from the original place where the framework offered)\n    46\t   * flask: `request.context`\n    47\t   * falcon: `req.context`\n    48\t   * starlette: `request.context`\n    49\t5. register to the web application `api.register(app)`\n    50\t6. check the document at URL location `/apidoc/redoc` or `/apidoc/swagger`\n    51\t\n    52\tIf the request doesn't pass the validation, it will return a 422 with JSON error message(ctx, loc, msg, type).\n    53\t\n    54\t## How To\n    55\t\n    56\t> How to add summary and description to endpoints?\n    57\t\n    58\tJust add docs to the endpoint function. The 1st line is the summary, and the rest is the description for this endpoint.\n    59\t\n    60\t> How to add description to parameters?\n    61\t\n    62\tCheck the [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/schema/) document about description in `Field`.\n    63\t\n    64\t> Any config I can change?\n    65\t\n    66\tOf course. Check the [config](https://spectree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) document.\n    67\t\n    68\tYou can update the config when init the spectree like: \n    69\t\n    70\t```py\n    71\tSpecTree('flask', title='Demo API', version='v1.0', path='doc')\n    72\t```\n    73\t\n    74\t> What is `Response` and how to use it?\n    75\t\n    76\tTo build a response for the endpoint, you need to declare the status code with format `HTTP_{code}` and corresponding data (optional).\n    77\t\n    78\t```py\n    79\tResponse(HTTP_200=None, HTTP_403=ForbidModel)\n    80\tResponse('HTTP_200') # equals to Response(HTTP_200=None)\n    81\t```\n    82\t\n    83\t> What should I return when I'm using the library?\n    84\t\n    85\tNo need to change anything. Just return what the framework required.\n    86\t\n    87\t> How to logging when the validation failed?\n    88\t\n    89\tValidation errors are logged with INFO level. Details are passed into `extra`. Check the [falcon example](examples/falcon_demo.py) for details.\n    90\t\n    91\t> How can I write a customized plugin for another backend framework?\n    92\t\n    93\tInherit `spectree.plugins.base.BasePlugin` and implement the functions you need. After that, init like `api = SpecTree(backend=MyCustomizedPlugin)`.\n    94\t\n    95\t> How can I change the response when there is a validation error? Can I record some metrics?\n    96\t\n    97\tThis library provides `before` and `after` hooks to do these. Check the [doc](https://spectree.readthedocs.io/en/latest) or the [test case](tests/test_plugin_flask.py). You can change the handlers for SpecTree or for a specific endpoint validation.\n    98\t\n    99\t## Demo\n   100\t\n   101\tTry it with `http post :8000/api/user name=alice age=18`. (if you are using `httpie`)\n   102\t\n   103\t### Flask\n   104\t\n   105\t```py\n   106\tfrom flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n   107\tfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field, constr\n   108\tfrom spectree import SpecTree, Response\n   109\t\n   110\t\n   111\tclass Profile(BaseModel):\n   112\t    name: constr(min_length=2, max_length=40) # Constrained Str\n   113\t    age: int = Field(\n   114\t        ...,\n   115\t        gt=0,\n   116\t        lt=150,\n   117\t        description='user age(Human)'\n   118\t    )\n   119\t\n   120\t    class Config:\n   121\t        schema_extra = {\n   122\t            # provide an example\n   123\t            'example': {\n   124\t                'name': 'very_important_user',\n   125\t                'age': 42,\n   126\t            }\n   127\t        }\n   128\t\n   129\t\n   130\tclass Message(BaseModel):\n   131\t    text: str\n   132\t\n   133\t\n   134\tapp = Flask(__name__)\n   135\tapi = SpecTree('flask')\n   136\t\n   137\t\n   138\t@app.route('/api/user', methods=['POST'])\n   139\t@api.validate(json=Profile, resp=Response(HTTP_200=Message, HTTP_403=None), tags=['api'])\n   140\tdef user_profile():\n   141\t    \"\"\"\n   142\t    verify user profile (summary of this endpoint)\n   143\t\n   144\t    user's name, user's age, ...

Define your data structure used in (query, json, headers, cookies, resp) with `pydantic.BaseModel`\n    37\t2. create `spectree.SpecTree` instance with the web framework name you are using, like `api = SpecTree('flask')`\n    38\t3. `api.validate` decorate the route with\n    39\t   * `query`\n    40\t   * `json`\n    41\t   * `headers`\n    42\t   * `cookies`\n    43\t   * `resp`\n    44\t   * `tags`\n    45\t4. access these data with `context(query, json, headers, cookies)` (of course, you can access these from the original place where the framework offered)\n    46\t   * flask: `request.context`\n    47\t   * falcon: `req.context`\n    48\t   * starlette: `request.context`\n    49\t5. register to the web application `api.register(app)`\n    50\t6. check the document at URL location `/apidoc/redoc` or `/apidoc/swagger`\n    51\t\n    52\tIf the request doesn't pass the validation, it will return a 422 with JSON error message(ctx, loc, msg, type).\n    53\t\n    54\t## How To\n    55\t\n    56\t> How to add summary and description to endpoints?\n    57\t\n    58\tJust add docs to the endpoint function.

Check the [config](https://spectree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) document.\n    67\t\n    68\tYou can update the config when init the spectree like: \n    69\t\n    70\t```py\n    71\tSpecTree('flask', title='Demo API', version='v1.0', path='doc')\n    72\t```\n    73\t\n    74\t> What is `Response` and how to use it?\n    75\t\n    76\tTo build a response for the endpoint, you need to declare the status code with format `HTTP_{code}` and corresponding data (optional).\n    77\t\n    78\t```py\n    79\tResponse(HTTP_200=None, HTTP_403=ForbidModel)\n    80\tResponse('HTTP_200') # equals to Response(HTTP_200=None)\n    81\t```\n    82\t\n    83\t> What should I return when I'm using the library?\n    84\t\n    85\tNo need to change anything. Just return what the framework required.\n    86\t\n    87\t> How to logging when the validation failed?\n    88\t\n    89\tValidation errors are logged with INFO level. Details are passed into `extra`. Check the [falcon example](examples/falcon_demo.py) for details.\n    90\t\n    91\t> How can I write a customized plugin for another backend framework?\n    92\t\n    93\tInherit `spectree.plugins.base.BasePlugin` and implement the functions you need. After that, init like `api = SpecTree(backend=MyCustomizedPlugin)`.\n    94\t\n    95\t> How can I change the response when there is a validation error? Can I record some metrics?\n    96\t\n    97\tThis library provides `before` and `after` hooks to do these. Check the [doc](https://spectree.readthedocs.io/en/latest) or the [test case](tests/test_plugin_flask.py). You can change the handlers for SpecTree or for a specific endpoint validation.\n    98\t\n    99\t## Demo\n   100\t\n   101\tTry it with `http post :8000/api/user name=alice age=18`.

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit a091fab020ac26548250c907bae0855273a98778.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n"

Just return what the framework required.\n    86\t\n    87\t> How to logging when the validation failed?\n    88\t\n    89\tValidation errors are logged with INFO level. Details are passed into `extra`. Check the [falcon example](examples/falcon_demo.py) for details.\n    90\t\n    91\t> How can I write a customized plugin for another backend framework?\n    92\t\n    93\tInherit `spectree.plugins.base.BasePlugin` and implement the functions you need. After that, init like `api = SpecTree(backend=MyCustomizedPlugin)`.\n    94\t\n    95\t> How can I change the response when there is a validation error? Can I record some metrics?\n    96\t\n    97\tThis library provides `before` and `after` hooks to do these. Check the [doc](https://spectree.readthedocs.io/en/latest) or the [test case](tests/test_plugin_flask.py). You can change the handlers for SpecTree or for a specific endpoint validation.\n    98\t\n    99\t## Demo\n   100\t\n   101\tTry it with `http post :8000/api/user name=alice age=18`.

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit a091fab020ac26548250c907bae0855273a98778.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n"

The problem is that when adding descriptions to schema fields used in query parameters, they don't show up in Swagger UI but they do show up in Redoc.\n\n2. Looking at the code snippet:\n   - There's a FastAPI route decorated with @api.validate(query=HelloForm) \n   - The HelloForm class inherits from BaseModel (likely from pydantic)\n   - One of the fields (msg) has a Field(description='msg test', example='aa') annotation\n   - Other fields like user, index, data, list are also defined\n\n3.

Check the [config](https://spectree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) document.\n    67\t\n    68\tYou can update the config when init the spectree like: \n    69\t\n    70\t```py\n    71\tSpecTree('flask', title='Demo API', version='v1.0', path='doc')\n    72\t```\n    73\t\n    74\t> What is `Response` and how to use it?\n    75\t\n    76\tTo build a response for the endpoint, you need to declare the status code with format `HTTP_{code}` and corresponding data (optional).\n    77\t\n    78\t```py\n    79\tResponse(HTTP_200=None, HTTP_403=ForbidModel)\n    80\tResponse('HTTP_200') # equals to Response(HTTP_200=None)\n    81\t```\n    82\t\n    83\t> What should I return when I'm using the library?\n    84\t\n    85\tNo need to change anything. Just return what the framework required.\n    86\t\n    87\t> How to logging when the validation failed?\n    88\t\n    89\tValidation errors are logged with INFO level. Details are passed into `extra`. Check the [falcon example](examples/falcon_demo.py) for details.\n    90\t\n    91\t> How can I write a customized plugin for another backend framework?\n    92\t\n    93\tInherit `spectree.plugins.base.BasePlugin` and implement the functions you need. After that, init like `api = SpecTree(backend=MyCustomizedPlugin)`.\n    94\t\n    95\t> How can I change the response when there is a validation error? Can I record some metrics?\n    96\t\n    97\tThis library provides `before` and `after` hooks to do these. Check the [doc](https://spectree.readthedocs.io/en/latest) or the [test case](tests/test_plugin_flask.py). You can change the handlers for SpecTree or for a specific endpoint validation.\n    98\t\n    99\t## Demo\n   100\t\n   101\tTry it with `http post :8000/api/user name=alice age=18`.
