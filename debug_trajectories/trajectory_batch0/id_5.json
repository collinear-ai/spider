This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6.

The problem is that protected keys (`protected_keys`) are not raising errors when used in translation files\\n2. Specifically mentioned are `_target` and `FORBIDDEN_KEYS` \\n3. These keys should not be allowed in translation files at all levels (both root level and nested levels)\\n4. When creating a Translator instance, there should be validation to catch these forbidden keys\\n\\nKey technical details:\\n- `protected_keys` is likely a configuration that defines keys that should not be used in translation files\\n- `_target` seems to be a specific forbidden key\\n- `FORBIDDEN_KEYS` is mentioned as another set of forbidden keys\\n- The issue occurs when instantiating a Translator object\\n- The error should be raised during object instantiation, not at runtime when accessing translations\\n\\nSteps to reproduce:\\n1. Create translation files with forbidden keys\\n2. Instantiate a Translator object with those files\\n3. No error should be raised, but it should\\n\\nBest practices for fixing:\\n- Need to validate translation files during initialization\\n- Should check both root level and nested levels for forbidden keys\\n- Should provide clear error messages indicating which keys are forbidden\\n- Minimal changes to existing functionality\"}"

Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\n_protected_keys are not raising error when used in translator\n`protected_keys` are not raising errors when used in a json translation file. It is also happening with the \"`FORBIDDEN_KEYS`\" when are used in nested levels.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce...\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n# set up the appropriate keys for each language\r\nkeys = {\r\n    \"en\": {\r\n        \"find_target\": \"A key\", \r\n        \"test_key\": \"Test key\", \r\n        \"nested\" : {\r\n            \"items\" : {\r\n                \"_target\" : \"value\"\r\n            },\r\n        },\r\n        \"merge_dict\" : \"value\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"fr\": {\r\n        \"a_key\": \"Une clef\", \r\n        \"test_key\": \"Clef de test\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"fr-FR\": {\r\n        \"a_key\": \"Une clef\", \r\n        \"test_key\": \"Clef de test\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"es\": {\r\n        \"a_key\": \"Una llave\"\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n\r\n# generate the tmp_dir in the test directory\r\ntmp_dir = Path(\".\").parent / \"data\" / \"messages\"\r\ntmp_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)\r\n\r\n# create the translation files\r\nfor lan, d in keys.items():\r\n    folder = tmp_dir / lan\r\n    folder.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\r\n    (folder / \"locale.json\").write_text(json.dumps(d, indent=2))\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhen the object is being instantiated, there's not any error to alert that the nested key \"`_target`\" cannot be used, nor the \"`find_target`\" in the first level.\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ntranslator = Translator(tmp_dir, \"en\")\r\n```\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 412e02ef08df68c256f384081d2c7eaecc09428e.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n"

READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 412e02ef08df68c256f384081d2c7eaecc09428e.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n"

These keys should be disallowed at both root level and nested levels within translation files.\n\n### 1.4 Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create JSON translation files containing forbidden keys (`_target`, `FORBIDDEN_KEYS`)\n2. Instantiate a `Translator` object with those files\n3. No error is raised when it should be\n\n### 1.5 Best Practices\n- Validate translation files during initialization\n- Check nested structures recursively\n- Provide clear error messages\n- Make minimal changes to existing functionality\n\n## Phase 2.

Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\n_protected_keys are not raising error when used in translator\n`protected_keys` are not raising errors when used in a json translation file. It is also happening with the \"`FORBIDDEN_KEYS`\" when are used in nested levels.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce...\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n# set up the appropriate keys for each language\r\nkeys = {\r\n    \"en\": {\r\n        \"find_target\": \"A key\", \r\n        \"test_key\": \"Test key\", \r\n        \"nested\" : {\r\n            \"items\" : {\r\n                \"_target\" : \"value\"\r\n            },\r\n        },\r\n        \"merge_dict\" : \"value\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"fr\": {\r\n        \"a_key\": \"Une clef\", \r\n        \"test_key\": \"Clef de test\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"fr-FR\": {\r\n        \"a_key\": \"Une clef\", \r\n        \"test_key\": \"Clef de test\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"es\": {\r\n        \"a_key\": \"Una llave\"\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n\r\n# generate the tmp_dir in the test directory\r\ntmp_dir = Path(\".\").parent / \"data\" / \"messages\"\r\ntmp_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)\r\n\r\n# create the translation files\r\nfor lan, d in keys.items():\r\n    folder = tmp_dir / lan\r\n    folder.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\r\n    (folder / \"locale.json\").write_text(json.dumps(d, indent=2))\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhen the object is being instantiated, there's not any error to alert that the nested key \"`_target`\" cannot be used, nor the \"`find_target`\" in the first level.\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ntranslator = Translator(tmp_dir, \"en\")\r\n```\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 412e02ef08df68c256f384081d2c7eaecc09428e.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n"

Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\n_protected_keys are not raising error when used in translator\n`protected_keys` are not raising errors when used in a json translation file. It is also happening with the \"`FORBIDDEN_KEYS`\" when are used in nested levels.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce...\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n# set up the appropriate keys for each language\r\nkeys = {\r\n    \"en\": {\r\n        \"find_target\": \"A key\", \r\n        \"test_key\": \"Test key\", \r\n        \"nested\" : {\r\n            \"items\" : {\r\n                \"_target\" : \"value\"\r\n            },\r\n        },\r\n        \"merge_dict\" : \"value\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"fr\": {\r\n        \"a_key\": \"Une clef\", \r\n        \"test_key\": \"Clef de test\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"fr-FR\": {\r\n        \"a_key\": \"Une clef\", \r\n        \"test_key\": \"Clef de test\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"es\": {\r\n        \"a_key\": \"Una llave\"\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n\r\n# generate the tmp_dir in the test directory\r\ntmp_dir = Path(\".\").parent / \"data\" / \"messages\"\r\ntmp_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)\r\n\r\n# create the translation files\r\nfor lan, d in keys.items():\r\n    folder = tmp_dir / lan\r\n    folder.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\r\n    (folder / \"locale.json\").write_text(json.dumps(d, indent=2))\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhen the object is being instantiated, there's not any error to alert that the nested key \"`_target`\" cannot be used, nor the \"`find_target`\" in the first level.\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ntranslator = Translator(tmp_dir, \"en\")\r\n```\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 412e02ef08df68c256f384081d2c7eaecc09428e.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n"

Consider the following issue description:\n\n<issue_description>\n_protected_keys are not raising error when used in translator\n`protected_keys` are not raising errors when used in a json translation file. It is also happening with the \"`FORBIDDEN_KEYS`\" when are used in nested levels.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce...\r\n\r\n```Python\r\n# set up the appropriate keys for each language\r\nkeys = {\r\n    \"en\": {\r\n        \"find_target\": \"A key\", \r\n        \"test_key\": \"Test key\", \r\n        \"nested\" : {\r\n            \"items\" : {\r\n                \"_target\" : \"value\"\r\n            },\r\n        },\r\n        \"merge_dict\" : \"value\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"fr\": {\r\n        \"a_key\": \"Une clef\", \r\n        \"test_key\": \"Clef de test\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"fr-FR\": {\r\n        \"a_key\": \"Une clef\", \r\n        \"test_key\": \"Clef de test\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"es\": {\r\n        \"a_key\": \"Una llave\"\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n\r\n# generate the tmp_dir in the test directory\r\ntmp_dir = Path(\".\").parent / \"data\" / \"messages\"\r\ntmp_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)\r\n\r\n# create the translation files\r\nfor lan, d in keys.items():\r\n    folder = tmp_dir / lan\r\n    folder.mkdir(exist_ok=True)\r\n    (folder / \"locale.json\").write_text(json.dumps(d, indent=2))\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhen the object is being instantiated, there's not any error to alert that the nested key \"`_target`\" cannot be used, nor the \"`find_target`\" in the first level.\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ntranslator = Translator(tmp_dir, \"en\")\r\n```\n</issue_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 412e02ef08df68c256f384081d2c7eaecc09428e.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n"
