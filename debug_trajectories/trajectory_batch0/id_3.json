This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 7eb3f48735e1cfeac75fecf88dd8194c8daea3d3.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n",

It suggests this could be handy for translator keys and faster\\n5. There's a side note that we'll need it anyway for the geemap drop\\n\\nKey technical details:\\n- Library: Box (https://github.com/cdgriffith/Box)\\n- Context: Translator keys\\n- Context: Geemap drop\\n\\nThe problem seems to be that the current implementation uses regular Python dictionaries for translator keys, but the suggestion is to use the Box library which provides a more convenient API for dictionary access.\\n\\nSteps to reproduce might involve understanding how translator keys are currently implemented and how Box would improve them.\\n\\nBest practices would be:\\n- Minimal changes to existing code\\n- Maintain backward compatibility if possible\\n- Follow existing code patterns\\n- Ensure the Box library is properly imported and used\"}"

RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5.

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 7eb3f48735e1cfeac75fecf88dd8194c8daea3d3.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n"

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 7eb3f48735e1cfeac75fecf88dd8194c8daea3d3.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n"

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 7eb3f48735e1cfeac75fecf88dd8194c8daea3d3.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n"

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 7eb3f48735e1cfeac75fecf88dd8194c8daea3d3.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n"

This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nAlso the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.\n\nFollow these phases to resolve the issue:\n\nPhase 1. READING: read the problem and reword it in clearer terms\n  1.1 If there are code or config snippets. Express in words any best practices or conventions in them.\n  1.2 Hightlight message errors, method names, variables, file names, stack traces, and technical details.\n  1.3 Explain the problem in clear terms.\n  1.4 Enumerate the steps to reproduce the problem.\n  1.5 Hightlight any best practices to take into account when testing and fixing the issue\n\nPhase 2. RUNNING: install and run the tests on the repository\n  2.1 Follow the readme\n  2.2 Install the environment and anything needed\n  2.2 Iterate and figure out how to run the tests\n\nPhase 3. EXPLORATION: find the files that are related to the problem and possible solutions\n  3.1 Use `grep` to search for relevant methods, classes, keywords and error messages.\n  3.2 Identify all files related to the problem statement.\n  3.3 Propose the methods and files to fix the issue and explain why.\n  3.4 From the possible file locations, select the most likely location to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 4. TEST CREATION: before implementing any fix, create a script to reproduce and verify the issue.\n  4.1 Look at existing test files in the repository to understand the test format/structure.\n  4.2 Create a minimal reproduction script that reproduces the located issue.\n  4.3 Run the reproduction script to confirm you are reproducing the issue.\n  4.4 Adjust the reproduction script as necessary.\n\nPhase 5. FIX ANALYSIS: state clearly the problem and how to fix it\n  5.1 State clearly what the problem is.\n  5.2 State clearly where the problem is located.\n  5.3 State clearly how the test reproduces the issue.\n  5.4 State clearly the best practices to take into account in the fix.\n  5.5 State clearly how to fix the problem.\n\nPhase 6. FIX IMPLEMENTATION: Edit the source code to implement your chosen solution.\n  6.1 Make minimal, focused changes to fix the issue.\n\nPhase 7. VERIFICATION: Test your implementation thoroughly.\n  7.1 Run your reproduction script to verify the fix works.\n  7.2 Add edge cases to your test script to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n  7.3 Run existing tests related to the modified code to ensure you haven't broken anything.\n\n8. FINAL REVIEW: Carefully re-read the problem description and compare your changes with the base commit 7eb3f48735e1cfeac75fecf88dd8194c8daea3d3.\n  8.1 Ensure you've fully addressed all requirements.\n  8.2 Run any tests in the repository related to:\n  8.2.1 The issue you are fixing\n  8.2.2 The files you modified\n  8.2.3 The functions you changed\n  8.3 If any tests fail, revise your implementation until all tests pass\n\n\nTest command:\npytest --no-header -rA --tb=line --color=no -p no:cacheprovider -W ignore::DeprecationWarning\n\n"

There's a side note that we'll need it anyway for the geemap drop\n\nKey technical details:\n- Library: Box (https://github.com/cdgriffith/Box)\n- Context: Translator keys\n- Context: Geemap drop\n\nThe problem seems to be that the current implementation uses regular Python dictionaries for translator keys, but the suggestion is to use the Box library which provides a more convenient API for dictionary access.\n\nSteps to reproduce might involve understanding how translator keys are currently implemented and how Box would improve them.\n\nBest practices would be:\n- Minimal changes to existing code\n- Maintain backward compatibility if possible\n- Follow existing code patterns\n- Ensure the Box library is properly imported and used"
